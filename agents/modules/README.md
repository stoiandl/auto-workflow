# Reviewer Modules

This folder contains optional, pluggable checklists for specific feature areas. The core
reviewer document references these modules when relevant; add new modules as the project evolves.

Suggested module naming: `<domain>.md` (e.g., `scheduling.md`, `artifacts.md`, `secrets.md`).

Each module should include:
- Purpose and scope
- Key correctness and safety checks
- Performance considerations
- Observability and ops hooks
- Minimal examples or test pointers
